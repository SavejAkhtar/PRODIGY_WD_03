# 🎮 PRODIGY_WD_03 - Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application

This is **Task 03** of my Web Development Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.  
The goal was to develop a **Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📝 Description

To build a tic-tac-toe web application, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
By implementing functions to handle user clicks, track the game state, and check for winning conditions, the application offers a smooth and interactive gameplay experience.

Users can play against each other or an AI opponent, aiming to place **three markers in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) to win the game.
